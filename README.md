I am not a gamer, programmer, or coder. I am a Chef, trying to break into Food Web Development.
I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm going to try.
I was a Cryptologist for the U.S. Navy, but that was 10 years ago. Besides, we just broke out codes that other people wrote. Much different. I'm hoping that background will aid  in my training for java coding.
